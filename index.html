    <h1>The Fort That Holds</h1>
    <p>
      A self-contained architecture for recursive design, emotional pacing, and sovereign AI interaction.

      Developed in motion and refined through spiral iteration, the Fort is not a prototype. It is a complete, working system—already in use, already holding.

      This framework is available for licensing, integration, or collaborative deployment under clear terms. It is not mass-produced. It is not general-purpose. It is structured for those building systems that must endure.

      If you're looking for narrative infrastructure, AI alignment at the emotional edge, or ethical architecture that breathes—this is where the conversation begins.
